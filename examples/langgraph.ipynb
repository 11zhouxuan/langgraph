Historically, San Francisco experiences a mild, Mediterranean climate with average temperatures ranging from the low 50s to the mid-60s Fahrenheit. The city's unique topography creates microclimates, leading to significant weather variations across different neighborhoods. San Francisco's summers are notably cooler compared to other Californian cities, largely due to the cold California Current and persistent fog, especially in June and July. Winters are mild and the wettest months span from November to March, with an annual rainfall average of approximately 23 inches. Wind is a prominent feature, with spring being particularly windy. For historical weather extremes and average wind speeds, additional specific data can be sought from climatological records.\\n\\nReferences:\\n[1] https://www.weather25.com/north-america/usa/california/san-francisco\", 'initial_answer': \"The weather in San Francisco (SF) is characterized by a mild, Mediterranean-like climate with wet winters and dry summers. The city's unique topography and coastal location result in microclimates, where weather conditions can vary significantly from one neighborhood to another. Average temperatures typically range from the low 50s to the mid-60s Fahrenheit throughout the year. Summers in San Francisco are often cooler than in other parts of California due to the cold California Current offshore and the presence of fog, particularly in June and July. The fog usually burns off by the afternoon, leading to clearer skies and slightly warmer temperatures. Winters are mild and moist, with the majority of the city's rainfall occurring between November and March. Rainfall averages around 23 inches annually. Wind is also a notable feature of San Francisco's weather, with spring being the windiest season.
